# Model Estimation by Example

[![Lifecycle Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-stable-green.svg)](https://www.tidyverse.org/lifecycle/)

This is the repo for the document found
[here](https://m-clark.github.io/models-by-example/), based on the raw code
repo- [Miscellaneous R Code](https://github.com/m-clark/Miscellaneous-R-Code/).
The document code has been tidied and may have other improvements relative to
the original repo, but remains a conceptual/tutorial endeavor to various
modeling  techniques and algorithms. It provides 'by-hand' demonstrations of
various models and algorithms. The goal is to take away some of the mystery of
them by providing clean code examples that are easy to run and compare with
other tools.  The primary functions are usually just a few lines of code, and in almost all
cases, comparisons are made to an R package result.  A few Python and other
language demos as well.
