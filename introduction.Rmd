# Introduction

This document provides 'by-hand' demonstrations of various models and
algorithms. The goal is to take away some of the mystery of them by providing
clean code examples that are easy to run and compare with other tools.

The code was collected over several years without respect to any previous code,
so is not exactly consistent in style.  But in general, within each demo you
will find some imported/simulated data, a primary estimating function, a
comparison of results with some R package, and a link to the source code that is
demonstrated.

This code is not meant to be extensive, or used in production, and in fact, some
of these would probably be considered of historical interest only.  To be clear,
almost everything here has a package/module that would do the same thing far
better and efficiently.  Note also, the document itself is also not an
introduction to any of these methods, and in fact contains very little
expository text, assuming the reader has some familiarity with the model and
possibly some reference text. This document is merely a learning tool for those
wanting to dive a little deeper.



The Original code for these demonstrations may be found at their original home here: https://github.com/m-clark/Miscellaneous-R-Code.


Many examples require some initial data processing or visualization via <span class="pack" style = "">ggplot2</span>, so it's assumed the <span class="pack" style = "">tidyverse</span> set of packages is loaded.



While I'm happy to fix any glaring errors and broken links, this is pretty much a completed document, except on the off chance I add to it on rare occasion. This code has accumulated over years, and I just wanted it in a nicer format.  Perhaps if others would like to add to it via pull requests, I would do so.
